v1.0

[*] Artificial Intelligence

- AIs are now able to build and prioritize outposts to protect their territory or expand beyond systems without planets or resources (including nebulae). Evangelical lifestyles will build star temples instead.
- AIs now expand outside their trade area when they are out of other options.
- AIs now build moon bases on planets when needed (excepted, of course, Star Children).
- AIs now slow down or even temporarily stop their colonization effort when necessary in order to maintain a budget buffer for other expenditures.
- Colonization prioritization has been revised and all randomness in the decision process has been replaced by a deterministic weighting.
- AIs now abandon certain planets if their estimated next budget becomes negative.
- AIs can now choose to focus on one particular area with their budget spending under certain circumstances.
- AIs can now borrow money from their next budget for construction projects critical to their development.
- AIs now build commerce stations to establish trade routes between their territories.
- AIS now build a factory in territories where no labor is available to establish a trade route.
- AIs now build research complexes if their research generation rate is too low.

[*] Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the dry dock construction menu would list different versions of a design under certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug with asteroid fields orbiting Local Asteroid Field Planets not being rendered in certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where persistent beam effects were not restored upon loading a save file.
- Fixed a bug where strategic icons of Ore asteroids spawned when a planet is destroyed were incorrectly set to resource asteroid icons.
- Fixed a bug where ore asteroids in the mirrored part of a dumbbell galaxy generated with the 'Perfect Mirror' option had a resource asteroid strategic icon.
- Fixed a bug where incremental Ore cost spent to build certain things would be refund the next increment's worth of Ore when refunded.
- Fixed a bug where elapsed time was not tracked correctly for empire-related attributes and planet statuses.
- Fixed a bug where status stacks spent to build certain things (like troop pods filled with troops) would only ever refund one instance instead of the correct amount when refunded.
- Fixed a bug where orbital types present in systems tracked by AIs were not loaded from a previously saved game.
- Fixed a bug where the game would crash when trying to display a Ringworld with certain older graphics card.

[*] Improvements

- The shipset selection box is now dynamically resized depending of the number of available shipsets.
- Added Advanced and Crazy options tabs for universe generation.
- Added FXAA graphics option.
- Added an option to automatically connect to the SR2 IRC.
- The IRC now pings you if a message is addressed to you or contains the string '%everyone%'.
- Added an option to enable playback of in-game music in the title screen.
