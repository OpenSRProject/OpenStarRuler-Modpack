All files containing human-readable text (`.txt`, `.as`, `.md`, `.design`, etc.) are 
licensed under the MIT open-source license, unless specified otherwise. (Giving due 
credit would be nice, though... as would open-sourcing your derivative works!)

All particle systems (`.ps`) are *also* licensed under the MIT license, though their 
reuse may be complicated.

`.obj` files, should any ever be added to the repository, are an exception to the above 
clauses, and will *not* be covered under the MIT license. Instead, they are covered 
under "all other file types".

All other file types (`.ogg`, `.png`, `.obj`, etc.) are considered to be the property 
of their respective creators and/or copyright holders, and may be removed from the 
repository at their request. It is not recommended to use these without prior 
consultation with the relevant authorities (or, at minimum, a copyright lawyer). They 
will be enumerated in the 'Art sources' section of this file, along with any relevant 
licensing information.

## Non-MIT Code

Any code blocks encapsulated in comments of the format `// BEGIN/END NON-MIT CODE - 
$SOURCE` are not covered by the MIT license, and instead follow the rules specified 
below for their respective values of `$SOURCE`. For instance:

```
// BEGIN NON-MIT CODE - DOF (Scaling)
// something something DOF code here
// END NON-MIT CODE
```

In the above example, `// something something DOF code here` would obey the rules 
specified for DOF.

One-liners annotated with `// NON-MIT CODE - $SOURCE` may also occur at some places in 
the mod. The rules are the same - for instance, `add(CardMode(this)); // NON-MIT CODE - 
DOF (Enabling Influence Peddling)` still counts as DOF code.
