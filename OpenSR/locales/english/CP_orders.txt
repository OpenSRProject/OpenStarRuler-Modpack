CHASE_ORDER: Chase $1
KEEP_DISTANCE: Keep Distance
KEEP_DISTANCE_DESC: <<
	The flagship will be automatically set to [img=ActionBarIcons::17;20/] [b]Keep Distance[/b] instead of [img=ActionBarIcons::16;20/] [b]Close In[/b] when built.

	This setting can always be changed on a ship manually. Keep Distance will make the ship avoid getting too close to its attack target but still stay within its configured engagement range.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20][i][color=#aaa]Recommended for mobile ships with long range weapons that have missiles or wide firing arcs.[/color][/i][/img]
