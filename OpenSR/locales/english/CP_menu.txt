OPT_AUTO_IRC: Automatically Connect to IRC
OPTTT_AUTO_IRC: When toggled on, the game will automatically connect to the IRC and join the #starruler channel when started.
OPT_MTE: Use Multiple Themes
OPTTT_MTE: <<
	When toggled on, the game will randomly select a valid .ogg file in data/music/theme to play while in the main menu. If no valid files are found, this option will automatically be switched off.
>>
OPT_THEME_LOOP: Loop Main Menu Theme
OPTTT_THEME_LOOP: <<
	When toggled on, the game will repeat the theme song as long as you're not in a match. If used alongside 'Use Multiple Themes', this will randomly cycle through all the files in data/music/theme.

NG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS: Advanced Options
NG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS_DESC: <<
	This tab contains options that, while (probably) safe to use, are not expected to be frequently used by players, and may sometimes cause balance issues or make some aspects of the game more difficult to use if they are misused.

	[i][b]Multiplayer hosts: It is recommended that these options not be used without the knowledge and consent of the people you are playing with.[/b][/i]

NG_PLANET_MOON_CHANCE: Moon Occurrence
NGTT_PLANET_MOON_CHANCE: The probability that a planet will have a moon. (Developer note: I suspect that the game will add moons to a planet until the random number generator fails to produce an acceptable number. Therefore, to prevent instances of locking up the game by telling it to spawn moons ad infinitum, this is capped at 50%. Also, odds are you'll change the amount of moons significantly even by slightly modifying this number.)

NG_PLANET_CONDITION_CHANCE: Condition Occurrence
NGTT_PLANET_CONDITION_CHANCE: The probability that a planet will have a planetary condition. Planetary conditions can have various effects on a planet and its behavior, ranging from a reduced population cap to powerful ancient weapons.

NG_HIDE_EMPIRE_RELATIONS: Hide Empire Relations
NGTT_HIDE_EMPIRE_RELATIONS: When checked, the game will hide relationships between empires from other empires. (Developer note: I think this is supposed to conceal treaties, but I'm not sure just what it DOES do.)

NG_TEAMS_START_CLOSE: Teams Start Together
NGTT_TEAMS_START_CLOSE: When checked, the game will try to place members of a team close to each other, as opposed to evenly distributing everyone across the galaxy.

NG_CARD_STACK_INTERVAL: Influence Stack Refresh Rate
NGTT_CARD_STACK_INTERVAL: How long it takes for the influence card stack to refresh. (Developer note: The timer above the right end of the stack - the thing that controls when new cards are added to/removed from the stack.)

NG_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_STEP: Energy Efficiency Step
NGTT_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_STEP: The amount of stored energy that will reduce an empire's energy generation rate by 50%. (Developer note: If you set this to 500, and collect 500 energy, plus your free storage cap, your empire's generation will be halved. If you collect 1000 energy - plus free storage cap - the already halved generation rate will be halved again, for a net energy generation reduction of 75%.)

NG_ENERGY_PER_SEEDSHIP: Energy per Seed Ship
NGTT_ENERGY_PER_SEEDSHIP: How much energy must be collected in the entire galaxy to spawn a new seed ship.

NG_SIEGE_LOYALTY_TIME: Siege Time
NGTT_SIEGE_LOYALTY_TIME: How long it takes to reduce a planet's loyalty by 10 points during a siege. Measured in seconds.

NG_SIEGE_LOYALTY_COST: Siege Cost
NGTT_SIEGE_LOYALTY_COST: How many supplies are required to reduce a planet's loyalty by 1 point during a siege.

NG_RANDOM_EVENT_INTERVAL: Random Event Interval
NGTT_RANDOM_EVENT_INTERVAL: The minimum acceptable interval between the occurance of two random events. After an event has occurred, no new random events can happen until this interval passes.

NG_LABOR_DUMP_TIME: Labor Storage Dump Time
NGTT_LABOR_DUMP_TIME: How long it takes to empty an object's Labor storage into a project. Measured in seconds.

NG_LEVEL_DECAY_TIME: Base Level Decay Time
NGTT_LEVEL_DECAY_TIME: How long it takes for a planet's level to decay if a vital resource is no longer available. Measured in seconds, and can be modified by empire- or planet-specific factors such as technological upgrades.

NG_DRYDOCK_BUILDCOST_FACTOR: Drydock Cost Multiplier
NGTT_DRYDOCK_BUILDCOST_FACTOR: When building from a drydock, this is how much of the ship's original build cost will have to be paid. Negated by the Decentralized Construction tech node.

NG_CRAZY_OPTIONS: Crazy Options
NG_CRAZY_OPTIONS_DESC: <<
	This tab contains options whose functionality is either approaching extreme (and possibly hazardous!) levels of control over the game's mechanics, or is just ludicrous. (Like asteroid mass. :P)

	[i][b][color=#f00]Use these options at your own peril.

	Multiplayer hosts, it is highly recommended that these options are left untouched without the express permission of everyone participating, and prior testing in a singleplayer match.[/color][/b][/i]

NG_ASTEROID_PERMANENT_FREQ: Asteroid Permanent Resource Frequency
NGTT_ASTEROID_PERMANENT_FREQ: The base frequency of permanent (non-consumable) resources on resource asteroids. (Developer note: I think. No idea how it works or if it even does what it says.)

NG_ASTEROID_MASS: Asteroid Mass
NGTT_ASTEROID_MASS: The mass of all the asteroids in the universe. (Developer note: Alternatively, the average mass of said asteroids.)

NG_SYSTEMS_PER_WORMHOLE: Systems per Wormhole
NGTT_SYSTEMS_PER_WORMHOLE: In a multi-galaxy game, how many star systems must exist in a galaxy(?) in order for a wormhole to another galaxy to spawn.

NG_GALAXY_MIN_WORMHOLES: Minimum Wormholes per Galaxy
NGTT_GALAXY_MIN_WORMHOLES: In a multi-galaxy game, how many wormholes must exist in a galaxy regardless of the galaxy's size and the game's 'Systems per Wormhole' setting.

NG_ARTIFACTS_SEEDSHIP_DEATH: Artifacts From Seed Ship Death
NGTT_ARTIFACTS_SEEDSHIP_DEATH: How many artifacts are spawned when a seed ship is destroyed.

NG_ASTEROID_COST_STEP: Asteroid Cost Step
NGTT_ASTEROID_COST_STEP: When building mining bases on asteroids from another star system, determines how much the Labor cost of construction is increased for every star system between the building planet and the asteroid. (Developer note: The shortest trade route is used, with each trade link increasing the cost by the percentage selected here.)

NG_TERRAFORM_COST_STEP: Terraforming Cost Step
NGTT_TERRAFORM_COST_STEP: When terraforming planets from another star system, determines how much the Labor cost of terraforming is increased for every star system between the terraforming planet and the terraformed planet. (Developer note: The shortest trade route is used, with each trade link increasing the cost by the percentage selected here.)

NG_ORBITAL_LABOR_COST_STEP: Orbital Labor Cost Step
NGTT_ORBITAL_LABOR_COST_STEP: When building orbitals from another star system, determines how much the Labor cost of construction is increased for every star system between the building planet and the desired location of the orbital. (Developer note: The shortest trade route is used, with each trade link increasing the cost by the percentage selected here.)
AA_FX: FXAA
OPT_FXAA: FXAA
OPTTT_FXAA: <<
	A cheapish antialiasing option used as an alternative to the malfunctioning MSAA antialiasing options.
>>
OPT_RINGWORLD_FIX: Safe Ringworlds
OPTTT_RINGWORLD_FIX: <<
	Disables a part of the Ringworld shader, preventing crashes with certain older graphics cards when using a shader quality level of Medium or higher.

	Due to the resulting loss of quality, it may be advisable not to enable this option if you are not experiencing issues with Ringworld-related crashes.
>>
OPT_QUICKBAR_MINLABOR: Minimum Labor Threshold
OPT_QUICKBAR_MINLABOR_DESC: <<
	This changes the minimum Labor generation a planet/orbital needs to have, in order to be visible on the "Planets/Orbitals with Labor" quickbar.

	This threshold is increased by 1 for Mechanoid races, since they are guaranteed to have at least 1 Labor on each of their planets. For example, if this setting is set to 1, a Mechanoid planet would need to generate 2 or more Labor per minute in order to be shown on the Labor object quickbar.
